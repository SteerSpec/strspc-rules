Project notes belong outside the managed block below. strspc-sync rewrites only
the section between the SteerSpec markers and leaves the rest of this file alone.

## SteerSpec org standards

Managed by [SteerSpec/.claude](https://github.com/SteerSpec/.claude) through
[strspc-sync](https://github.com/SteerSpec/strspc-sync). Change
`templates/CLAUDE.md.mustache` there; edits made here are overwritten by the
next sync.

- **Tiers.** strspc-rules (rule definitions) → strspc-manager (Go engine) →
  strspc-CLI and the other consumers of strspc-manager. Dependencies point
  downward only. Release and tag upstream before bumping a downstream `go.mod`
  or core pin.
- **Pull requests only.** Org rulesets reject direct pushes to the default
  branch and require verified commit signatures; Copilot review and
  pr-auto-approve gate the merge. Agents open PRs and never merge them.
- **Conventional commits** (`type(scope): subject`). Where a repo uses
  release-please, it derives versions and changelogs from them; other repos
  follow the release process in their own README or AGENTS.md.
- **Rules live next to the code.** Each repo owns a realm under `rules/` that
  depends on `dev.steerspec.core`. Author rules through `strspc rule …` so the
  content hashes stay valid; never hand-edit rule JSON.
- **Rule states.** Draft text may still change. Published text is final while
  the code may still violate it. Implemented is enforced in CI (`fail_on: [I]`);
  promote to Implemented only once the code complies.
- **Work tracking.** Multi-session work is tracked in beads (`bd`), not in
  markdown todo files.
- **Org agents.** Architect, Agile PM, Code Review and Release come from the
  `strspc-agents` plugin: `/plugin marketplace add SteerSpec/.claude`, then
  `/plugin install strspc-agents@steerspec`.
